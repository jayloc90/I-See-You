Enter the highlighted url on the main screen where it asks for `Enter the URL generated by Serveo` and hit `Enter`:

This URL is generated randomly for different users. However, it will be a subdomain for the serveo.net domain. Send this URL to your victim as part of the phishing campaign via email or any other medium. Victim will see the site as below:

Note: You can be creative and modify the look and feel of the page as per your requirement.

Once the targeted users allows location permission, malicious user will receive exact location of the victim in the tail screen. These numbers are `longitude and latitude` of the user.

Using `https://maps.google.com` you can convert the `longitude and latitude` to an exact location:
